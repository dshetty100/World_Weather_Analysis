# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Goal
- The goal of this project is to develop a PlanMyTripp app that would aid the client in preparing 
for his/her trip anywhere in the world.

## Project Description
- In this project we collect weather data from various cities around the world using the website, 
OpenWeatherMap, and by making an API call to the website. The data is then read into pandas dataframe 
and stored in a csv file.


- We then Use input statements from customers to retrieve their weather preferences, and use those 
preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The preferred destinations 
are then shown on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

- We then use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four 
cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Finally, we create a marker layer 
map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
